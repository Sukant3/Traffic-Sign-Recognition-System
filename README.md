Project_Info_

The system is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset and leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) model optimized for traffic sign recognition efficiency. The interface allows users to upload an image of a traffic sign, which is then classified into one of 43 categories. Corresponding road safety guidelines are displayed for each sign. The model achieves over 95% test accuracy and is integrated with a Gradio-based interface to simulate practical deployment for driver assistance and road safety educational tools.
